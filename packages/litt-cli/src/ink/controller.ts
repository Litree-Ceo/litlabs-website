/**
 * CockpitController — routes user input to ExecutionGateway.
 *
 * The controller is the bridge between the CommandDock and the
 * ExecutionGateway. It translates user intent (natural language or
 * slash commands) into gateway requests.
 *
 * CRITICAL: The controller NEVER executes anything directly.
 * No exec(), spawn(), child_process, shelljs, or execa().
 * Everything goes through ExecutionGateway.
 *
 * Approval flow:
 *   gateway.execute() → require_approval → onApprovalRequired callback
 *   → ApprovalBridge.request() → Promise<boolean> pending
 *   → UI shows ApprovalUX → user presses A/D
 *   → ApprovalBridge.decide() → Promise resolves
 *   → gateway verifyApproval() → VerifiedApproval → SAME execution continues
 *
 * The controller NEVER reissues the command after approval.
 * The same runId, toolCallId, and operation digest flow through.
